    I had a dream last night. It felt like I was playing a weird first-person video game, there
    was an arm in my field of view, but the camera was so low to the ground that it felt like I 
    wasn't human. Just this weird arm-worm thing being propelled by some weird tentacles.

    I was in this sequence of tall rooms covered in seafoam-colored pool tiling, there was this weird
    purple goop everywhere. It had the color and consistency of Grimace Shake. I would enter a room,
    crawl like a worm through a drain at the bottom, and would fall down into another pool-room.

    At the very bottom, there was a final room, that was different from the others. It wasn't as tall,
    it honestly was kind of claustrophobic; it was a little wider. There was this conveyor belt just 
    endlessly dumping fumos into an open pit. Wasn't sure which fumo, it had green hair. There was a
    big vat of the purple stuff bubbling nearby, and a what looked like a little nozzle attached to
    a lavender-colored sausage casing. Somehow, I intuited that if I filled up the casing with fumos,
    something would happen.

    Wasn't sure what.
